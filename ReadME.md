HELLO WORLD! This is a project I created when completing a course on Udemy called the Web Developer Bootcamp, with Colt Steele. This course, found here: https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp is an awesome resource.

The app is built with Node, using Express for routing, EJS for templating, and MongoDB as the database.
